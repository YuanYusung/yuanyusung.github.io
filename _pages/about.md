Welcome! I am a novice seismologist currently working on **dense seismic array signal processing and imaging**.

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in **Geophysics** at **China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)**. 
I expect to graduate in **June 2026**. During my studies, I received the National Scholarship of China and 
the Best Individual Award in the ”Innovation Cup“ Chinese University Students Geophysics Knowledge Competition, among other honors. 
I am now working under the guidance of [**Prof. Qiu Hongrui**](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/qiuhongrui/zh_CN/index.htm), 
focusing on dense seismic array surface wave denoising and higher mode surface wave separation, and their applications in seabed and fault zone imaging, 
using both **distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)**  and **dense nodal seismic array** technologies. In **September 2026**, 
I plan to pursue a **PhD in Geophysics** at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)** 
under the guidance of [**Prof. Yao Huajian**](http://yaolab.ustc.edu.cn).
