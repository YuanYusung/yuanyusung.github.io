Welcome to Yusong's personal website! I am a novice seismologist currently researching **dense seismic array signal processing and imaging**. I'm also an amateur music lover, literature enthusiast, and enjoy swimming, table tennis and hiking.

I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in **Geophysics** at **China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)**. 
I expect to graduate in **June 2026**. During my studies, I received the National Scholarship of China and 
the Best Individual Award in the “Innovation Cup” Chinese University Students Geophysics Knowledge Competition, among other honors. 
I am currently working under the guidance of [Prof. Qiu Hongrui](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/qiuhongrui/zh_CN/index.htm), 
researching dense seismic array surface wave denoising and higher mode surface wave separation methods, and their applications in seabed and fault zone imaging, 
using both **distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)**  and **dense nodal seismic array** technologies. In **September 2026**, 
I plan to pursue a **PhD in Geophysics** at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)** 
under the guidance of [Prof. Yao Huajian](http://yaolab.ustc.edu.cn).

This website, created using the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template, is still under development.
